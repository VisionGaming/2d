
=========================================
Logic change, overlays will go away
spritesheets will become

action_direction_subaction_subactionverb

e.g.
still_left_gun_shoot
swim_down_gun_shoot
swim_up_gun_shoot

notes there will always be a default direction
========================================================

This logic will be removed:

Logic change / Bug, man should have still left and still right
so when standing still can shoot the direction he is facing.
========================================================



Intro
	play

Main level 
	a level with multiple levels

When level cleared go back to level zero



**Outstanding bits and pieces**

Objects that appear randomly for a random time
Messages - Thought bubbles "Get The..." remove?
Game Intro
Game Map / Level / inter level display 
Saved high score
Level score resets after death

Baddie new properties {
	specialAbility: vaccuum udlr, blower udlr	
}

maybe Trigger could inherit from object and have overridable properties
A TriggerObject is a standard object with extra features

TriggerObject {

	-- insert regular object properties --

				name, 
				spriteSheet, 
				power,                 // the power is held by the player and shown at the top
				message,
				messageScalePercentage,
				spriteCoda
				playTimes
				frameInterval
				displaySizePercent
				padding: {left:10, right:10, top:10, bottom:10} // padding of the object for collision detection
				powerIncrement
				points


	// a delay before the object appears -1 = random
	visibility {
		delay: -1 - n frames
		duration: -1 - n frames
	}

	exit: {
		isExit: true / false
		nextLevel: 0 - maxLevels
	}

	// toggle an object
	switch {
		isSwitch: true / false
		state: true / false

		targetObject {
			x:0, 
			y:0
		}

		state: {
			mode: true / false
			off:{ 
				isSolid: true / false
				spriteSheet: ""
		 	},
		 	on:{ 
				isSolid: true / false
				spriteSheet: ""
		 	}
		}
	}
}
